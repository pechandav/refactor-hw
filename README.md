# Code Refactor Homework
The purpose of this homework is to refactor the page Horiseon.
Refactoring means to improve the structure of an existing code. It does not interfere or change the functionality of the code.
Refactoring the code for the Horiseon website will add things like reader accesibility and to make the code cleaner and easier to read.

## Horiseon
```
Horiseon is a marketing agency. The purpose of their company is to help companies and businesses boost their presence online. 
This will help attract more customers by bringing them to their website.
```
## Work Done
```
I added alt attributes to the images on the page so that if their browser couldn't load images, there would be a description of what the image may be.
I made sure that the links on the top of the page in the Header were working properly. I added the appropriate divId and class names to them.
I made sure there were breaks in each line of code so that your eye can naivgate through the code with ease.
